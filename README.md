Alex R Winter: Sound Engineer, professional website.

The business objectives of this project are to create a professional website for a self-employed Sound Editor working mainly for film and TV.
The client has an existing previous website for a studio business he ran and wants a new website which is just for him and his services as a self-employed Sound Editor. The client's previous website was quite 'busy', the information was not clearly laid out, and the colour were dark and hot. We are going for a new, cleaner, clearer professional image.

The client wants to market their service to reach a wider client base, and get hired. Employers will want to see examples of projects my client has worked on, experience in this area of work and work history. Employers should be able to easily view what services my client provides, their expertise in their area of work, and be able to contact my client easily.
Business objectives: promote service, get contacted by employers, get hired.
User objectives: find out about the service, the credibility of the individual and contact the individual easily.
The website will include contact information, imdb profile, testimonials from previos employers/clients, films worked on and links to social media. It will not include a CV due to the niche area of work and relevance to projects worked on rather than employment history.

The layout will be a continuous page, with clearly divided sections. There will be an extra 'about me' section which can be expanded into a new window. This is so that the information is presented in a clear and simple way.

The website landing page will be clear and simple, in light colors, with a hero image which represents the service/ industry. The brand name (Alex R Winter) and the service provided will be the most obvious elements of the page, followed by a contact link.
The pages the follows will be:
1. Services provided
2. a brief 'about' statement including values/ approach/ credentials -> this will link to another 'about me' page in a new tab if the user desires. 
3. films worked on -> this will include links to the film's imdb pages.
4. testimonials from clients
5. contact & social media (with a 'footer' appearance)

Color scheme will be pale blue and neutrals. Blue is associated with calm, depth and stability, and perhaps intelligence. This service is reliable, provided by someone with a depth of knowledge in his field, from technical ability to intuitive creativity. The employer choosing something represented by this colour will be choosing calm, clarity, professionalism.
