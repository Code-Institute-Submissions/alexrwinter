<h1 align="center">Alex R Winter: Post Production Sound</h1>

<p>A professional website for a self-employed Sound Designer/Editor (who I will refer to as 'A Winter') working mainly for film and TV.
The website includes a brief professional 'about' summary for Alex R Winter, a summary of services provided, project history, testimonials and contact details.
The fundamental purpose of the website is to encourage potential collaborators and clients to make contact with A Winter.</p>

<p>B2B website...</p>

<h2>Business Objectives</h2>
- Promote the service provided (i.e.post production sound)<br>
- Create business connections by encouraging clients to make contact <br>
- Excellent UX design to encourage this and keep clients on the page<br>
- Clearly display the credentials of A Winter in his field<br>
- Give a clean, modern, professional image

<h2>Client Objectives</h2>
- Looking for a sound editor for their project, or working in a related field looking for contacts
- Clear and simple information
- Find out the credibility of individual/ service
- Get a sense of who this person is (a personable yet professional image: someone they want to work with or know professionally)
- Easy to contact and easy to connect with online (esp. LinkedIn)


The website will include services provided, contact information, imdb profile, testimonials from previos employers/clients, previous films worked on and links to social media. It will not include a CV due to the niche area of work and relevance to projects worked on rather than employment history.

The layout will be a continuous page, with clearly divided sections. There will be an extra 'about me' section which can be expanded into a new window. The decision to use one page is so that the information is presented in a clear and simple way. Including an about me allows for the emplyer to view the potential employee in a more personal way, as this is a self-employed person rather than a business. However, including too much personal information on the main page will clutter the clear and professional message and layout which we want to present.

The website landing page will be clear and simple, in light colors, with a hero image which represents the service/ industry. The brand name (Alex R Winter) and the service provided will be the most obvious elements of the page, followed by a contact link. The heading will breifly name services provided in smaller lettering so that the purpose of the website is clear from the outset.
The landing page will also have a header with social media links, including the client's imdb page. There will be an arrow indicating that the user should scroll, plus part of the next page showing at the bottom of the screen so that the existence of more comntent is clear and intuitive.

The sections that follow will be:
1. A brief 'about' statement including values/ approach/ credentials -> this will link to another 'about me' page in a new tab if the user desires. 
2. Services provided (with more detail)
3. Testimonials from clients
4. Projects/Films worked on -> this will include links to the film's imdb pages.
5. Contact & social media (with a 'footer' appearance)

The menu bar will appear once the user has navigated beyond the landing page. It will be vertical, and will highlight which section of the website is being viewed as the user scrolls. This will give a sense of flow, logical progression and clarity to the page's contents. It will allow the user to be aware at all times of where they are on the page in relation to the other information.

The colour scheme will be pale blue and neutrals. Blue is associated with calm, depth, stability and intelligence. This service is reliable, provided by someone with a depth of knowledge in his field, from technical ability to intuitive creativity. The employer choosing something represented by this colour will be choosing calm, clarity, professionalism. We want to communicate careful thought, precision, intelligence, approachability, and creativity.
