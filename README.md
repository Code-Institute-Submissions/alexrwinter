<h1 align="center">Alex R Winter: Post Production Sound</h1>

<p>A professional website for a self-employed Sound Designer/Editor (who I will refer to as 'A Winter') working mainly for film and TV.
The website includes a brief professional 'about' summary for Alex R Winter, a summary of services provided, project history, testimonials from previous collaborators/ clients and contact details.
The fundamental purpose of the website is to encourage potential collaborators and clients to make contact with A Winter.</p>

<p>B2B rather than B2C: Visitors will not be purchasing anything on the website, and most likely not contacting for a quote on the first visit; instead they will be researching possible collaborators for a specific project, or looking for networking opportunities for future collaborations. They will want to use a service which is professional and reliable. They will want to see that this person is an expert in their field. The 'about' section will give information of A Winter's background and experience in post production sound, and projects worked on will further establish this. The presence of an IMDb profile alongside many contact methods and a wide-reaching online presence (social media etc) will give a sense of reliability, which will also be backed up by on-site testimonials.</p>
<p>The website will include services provided, contact information, imdb profile, professional background, testimonials from previous employers/clients, previous films worked on and links to social media.</p>

<h2>Business Objectives</h2>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>The information is divided into sections on a scroll format for a modern appearance which is mobile-friendly and to create a sense of simplicity, continuity and clarity.</p>
<p>The website's main navigation bar is responsive, and highlights which section of the website is being viewed as the user scrolls: This gives a sense of flow and logical progression to the page's contents and allows the user to be aware at all times of where they are on the page in relation to the other information. For full screen and tablets the navbar is vertical whilst on mobile devices it collapses into a burger icon which can be expanded to a centred navigation bar located at the top of the page so as not to take up too much screen space.</p>
<p>The bottom of the website has a footer to hold all the social media links and sits beneath the other contact information at the base of the page.</p>
<p>The colour scheme will be greens and neutrals. This service is reliable, provided by someone with a depth of knowledge in his field, from technical ability to intuitive creativity. The colour scheme communicates careful thought, precision, intelligence, approachability, and creativity. The hero image is designed to appeal visually to the user and create a positive emotional resposnse, featuring a calming colour gradient from green to white and an image of digital sound waves.</p>

<h3>Home</h3>
<p>The website landing page will be clear and simple with a hero image which represents the service/ industry. The brand name (Alex R Winter) and the service provided will be the most obvious elements of the page for clarity's sake, followed by a large contact button. The landing page will also have a nav header with a link to Alex Winter's IMDb page as this is the most important online presence in terms of this industry. There will be an arrow indicating that the user should scroll so that the existence of more comntent is clear and intuitive.</p>

<h3>About</h3>
<p>Including an 'about' section allows for client to view the potential collaborator in a more personal way; this is a self-employed person rather than a business. It also gives the opportunity to summarise Alex Winter's professional and academic background in the field. This will be very brief (including too much personal information on the main page will clutter the clear and professional message and layout which we want to present). On mobile and tablet some of this information will be expandable. The page will also include a 'Let's work tohether' link to the contact section. On tablets and larger screens, the section will also include a photograph.</p>

<h3>Services</h3>
<p>Services can be broken down into three main items, which are briefly expalined in a context of 'what I can do for you' with an explanation for clarity. They will be under three headers and have icons to symbolise the processes. This information will not be collapsible because they are short paragraphs and easy to scroll past if they aren't of interest to the viewer.</p>
