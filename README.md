### B2B Strategy
B2B rather than B2C: Visitors will not be purchasing anything on the website, and most likely not contacting for a quote on the first visit; instead they will be researching possible collaborators for a specific project, or looking for networking opportunities for future collaborations. They will want to use a service which is professional and reliable. They will want to see that this person is an expert in their field.




## Scope/ Structure
-----------------------------------------

### Sections & features to be included:
* Landing section: title to give clear message, contact callout button to address central purpose of site, hero image which represents the industry.
* About section: articulate the academic background and professionalism of the individual.
* Services section: brief, clear summary of what this person does/ can do for you on a practical, applied level.
* Projects section: job titles and films worked on accompanied by images and with links to relevant IMDb pages; a project history.
* Testimonials section: testimonials from other clients/collaborators.
* Contact section: all methods of contact displayed: social media, IMDb, address, telephone number and email, plus a contact form for ease of communication and to encourage the user to make contact.
* Navigation bar: tie the website together by highlighting the section currently being viewed.

**Client perspective:** The 'about' section gives information on professional background and experience in post production sound, and projects worked on further establishes this. The presence of an IMDb profile alongside many contact methods and a wide-reaching online presence (social media etc) gives a sense of reliability, which is also backed up by on-site testimonials.

**Business perspective:** Homepage makes services clear and calls out for user to make contact. Gives professional, clean image. Simple clear information and a variety of ways to make contact addressess this core purpose. Services and examples of work gives an idea of the kinds of roles which are preferable/ suitable.

### Wireframes
Wireframes for mobile, iPad and Desktop can be seen [HERE](https://xd.adobe.com/view/bfa0d734-a9b5-4bc9-40e0-f88ad7fa45d7-c991/).

### Features (& Rationale)
The information is divided into sections on a scroll format for a modern appearance which is mobile-friendly and to create a sense of simplicity, continuity and clarity.

The website's **main navigation bar** is responsive, and highlights which section of the website is being viewed as the user scrolls: This gives a sense of flow and logical progression to the page's contents and allows the user to be aware at all times of where they are on the page in relation to the other information. For full screen and tablets the navbar is vertical, sticks to the top right of the page and is always visible. On mobile devices it collapses into a burger icon which can be expanded to a centred navigation bar located at the top of the page so as not to take up too much screen space. On both smaller and larger screens the navigation bar has a scrollspy which allows the user to see which psection they are viewing. Both the navigation bar and the **header** have a link to IMDb so that its presence is always visible.

In terms of connecting with potential clients, the website features a user-friendly **contact form** with required fields and a required valid email address. The bottom of the website has a **footer** to hold all the social media links and sits beneath the other contact information at the base of the page. This section is linked to from various other points in the site, including a large **'call to action' button** on the landing page.

The colour scheme is greens and neutrals. This service is reliable, provided by someone with a depth of knowledge in his field, from technical ability to intuitive creativity. The **hero image** has been designed for purpose is designed to appeal visually to the user and create a positive emotional resposnse, featuring a calming colour gradient from white to green and an image of digital sound waves. Some **animations** from [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) are also used on the landing page titles to 'welcome' the user to the website.

### Home
The website landing page is clear and simple with a hero image which represents the service/ industry. The brand name (Alex R Winter) and the service provided are the most obvious elements of the page for clarity's sake, followed by a large contact button. This information will appear on the screen slowly (0.5s) once the user has navigated to the page. The animation draws attention to the information being displayed and also adds to the user experience; giving a sense of user interractivity.
The landing page has a mini header with a link to Alex Winter's IMDb page as this is the most important online presence in terms of this industry. There is an animated arrow indicating that the user should scroll down, making the existence of more content clear and intuitive.

### About
Including an 'about' section allows for client to view the potential collaborator in a more personal way; this is a self-employed person rather than a business. It also gives the opportunity to summarise Alex Winter's professional and academic background in the field. This is very brief (including too much personal information on the main page woukd clutter the clear and professional message and layout which we want to present). On mobile and tablet some of this information will be expandable.

The page will also include a 'Let's work together' link to the contact section. On tablets and larger screens the section will include a photograph.

### Services
Services can be broken down into three main items: Dialogue Edit, Sound Design and Re-Recording Mixer, which are briefly expalined in a context of what the services are and 'what I can do for you'. The items come under three headings with icons to symbolise the processes. This information isn't collapsible because they are short paragraphs and easily scrolled past if they aren't of interest to the viewer. The section is responsive and the content changes from being organised horizonally on larger screens to vertically on smaller screens.

### Projects
The projects section features films which Alex Winter has worked on. The film is named, along with the year of release and the job title. There is an image cut from the poster of the film, which acts as a link to the releavnt IMDb page and responds visually ('lights up') when hovered over or clicked to make the image's 'clickability' clear. This section displays Alex Winter's experience in the services which are described in the previous section. The section is expandable to show more pojects. The section changes from stacked images with headers in mobile view to a fuller-screen view on tablet and PC.

### Testimonials
The testimonials section builds on the previous two sections and features two glowing testimonials from past collaborators. This content is also responsive, shifting from horizontal on larger screens to vertical on smaller screens. The font here is slightly less bold than other fonts on the site as this information is not part of the business' message, rather, it is extra supporting information.

### Contact
The contact section, which is linked to from various other points in the website, offers different ways of making contact, from a user-friendly contact form which is headed with a 'Let's work together' title and an invitaion to get in touch for different reasons, with a friendly and approachable tone. Beneath this is the address, phone number and email to extend contactability. On smaller screens, this is collapsed into the contact form and phone number (without the email or address) for visual design reasons and because the contact form will send an email so this address is not strictly necessary, nor is the postal address, but the presence of multiple contact methods on a larger screen adds to the user experience and visual design and the impression of contactability and reliability.

Directly beneath the contact section is the footer with all of Alex Winter's social media links for extended contact options, and a way for cients to connect and network via social media including LinkedIn.

_**Notes on media queries in CSS file:**_
*I have chosen to leave media queries inline instead of putting them at the bottom of each section or the bottom of the document as a matter of preference; I have decided to do it this way because I find it easier to see exactly how each element is being changed at each breakpoint and therefore easier to edit the code if necessary.*


## Deployment

The site is developed in GitPod IDE, from where changes are committed and pushed to the master branch in the Github repository.
This site is hosted using GitHub Pages, which publishes the website directly from the master branch in the Github repository. The website is automatically updated on GitHub Pages when changes are made to the master branch.

To set up GitHub Pages, create a GitHub account and create a new repository by clicking the 'Repositories' tab and then 'new'. Once your GitHub repository is set up (for this to work, the landing page must be named index.html) click 'Settings' and scroll down to the subheading 'GitHub Pages' from where you can publish the site.
