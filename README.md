Alex R Winter: Sound Engineer, professional website.

The business objectives of this project are to create a professional website for a self-employed Sound Editor working mainly for film and TV.
The client has an existing previous website for a studio business he ran and wants a new website which is just for him and his services as a self-employed Sound Editor. The client's previous website was quite 'busy', the information was not clearly laid out, and the colours were dark and hot (black, red, purple). We are going for a new, cleaner and clearer, modern and professional image.

The client wants to market their service to reach a wider client base and get hired. Employers will want to see examples of projects my client has worked on and his experience and successes in this area of work. Employers should be able to easily view what services my client provides, his expertise in his area of work, and be able to contact my client easily.

Business objectives: promote service, get contacted by employers, get hired.

User objectives: Find out about services provided, see the credibility of the individual and contact the individual easily.

The website will include services provided, contact information, imdb profile, testimonials from previos employers/clients, previous films worked on and links to social media. It will not include a CV due to the niche area of work and relevance to projects worked on rather than employment history.

The layout will be a continuous page, with clearly divided sections. There will be an extra 'about me' section which can be expanded into a new window. The decision to use one page is so that the information is presented in a clear and simple way. Including an about me allows for the emplyer to view the potential employee in a more personal way, as this is a self-employed person rather than a business. However, including too much personal information on the main page will clutter the clear and professional message and layout which we want to present.

The website landing page will be clear and simple, in light colors, with a hero image which represents the service/ industry. The brand name (Alex R Winter) and the service provided will be the most obvious elements of the page, followed by a contact link. The heading will breifly name services provided in smaller lettering so that the purpose of the website is clear from the outset.
The landing page will also have a header with social media links, including the client's imdb page. There will be an arrow indicating that the user should scroll, plus part of the next page showing at the bottom of the screen so that the existence of more comntent is clear and intuitive.

The sections that follow will be:
1. A brief 'about' statement including values/ approach/ credentials -> this will link to another 'about me' page in a new tab if the user desires. 
2. Services provided (with more detail)
3. Testimonials from clients
4. Projects/Films worked on -> this will include links to the film's imdb pages.
5. Contact & social media (with a 'footer' appearance)

The menu bar will appear once the user has navigated beyond the landing page. It will be vertical, and will highlight which section of the website is being viewed as the user scrolls. This will give a sense of flow, logical progression and clarity to the page's contents. It will allow the user to be aware at all times of where they are on the page in relation to the other information.

The colour scheme will be pale blue and neutrals. Blue is associated with calm, depth, stability and intelligence. This service is reliable, provided by someone with a depth of knowledge in his field, from technical ability to intuitive creativity. The employer choosing something represented by this colour will be choosing calm, clarity, professionalism. We want to communicate careful thought, precision, intelligence, approachability, and creativity.
